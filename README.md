## ⚙️ Configuration Setup (.env)

Ensure you have correct configuration parameters in both root and backend environments.

### 1. Root `.env` (Frontend config & fallback)
Create or check a `.env` file in the project root:
```env
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5001
AHMED_SIR_EMAIL=ahmed@whitehorsemanpower.in
JWT_SECRET=ats_secret_key_2026
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster.mongodb.net/ats_db
```

### 2. Backend `.env` (`/backend/.env`)
Create or edit a `.env` file inside the `backend/` folder:
```env
PORT=5001
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/ats_db # Or MongoDB Atlas connection string
JWT_SECRET=ats_secret_key_2026
AHMED_SIR_EMAIL=ahmed@whitehorsemanpower.in
CORS_ORIGIN=http://localhost:7899
```

## 📥 Installation & Local Development Setup

Follow these steps to set up the project locally.

### Step 1: Install Frontend Dependencies
From the root of the project, run:
```bash
npm install
```

### Step 2: Install Backend Dependencies
Navigate to the backend directory and install its dependencies:
```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

### Step 3: Seed the Database 🗄️
Before running the application, seed the MongoDB database with initial sample candidates, system users, and portal configurations:
```bash
# Inside the backend directory
npm run seed
```
> ⚠️ **Warning:** Running this seed script will clear existing collections in the database and repopulate them with fresh seed data.

#### 👥 Default Seeded Accounts for Testing:
| Role | Email | Password | WFH Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Admin** | `admin@whitehorsemanpower.in` | `Password2026!` | Office |
| **Recruiter** | `priya@whm.com` | `password123` | WFH |
